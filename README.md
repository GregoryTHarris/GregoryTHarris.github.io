This is my 1st attempt with Github.  Not much to comment on but I am trying to soak it all in! 
Not sure I did this repository correctly. All i did was just use my original files for my persoanl website and uploaded them to here.
Juyst followed instructions and made a clone repository and copy/pasted my website files to it!
